Buttons and LEDs
================

  Buttons
  -------
  The Spark has two mechanical buttons. One button is the RESET button
  connected to the STM32F103CB's reset line via /RST and the other is a
  generic user configurable button labeled BTN and connected to GPIO
  PB2/BOOT1. Since on the Spark, BOOT0 is tied to GND it is a moot point
  that BTN signal is connected to the BOOT1 signal. When a button is
  pressed it will drive the I/O line to GND.

  LEDs
  ----
  There are 4 user-controllable LEDs in two packages on board the Spark board:

      Sigal      Location     Color        GPIO    Active
      -------    ------------ -----------  -----  -----------
      LED1      LED_USR      Blue  LED    PA13    High  Common With D7
      LED2      LED_RGB      Red   LED    PA8     Low
      LED3      LED_RGB      Blue  LED    PA9     Low
      LED4      LED_RGB      Green LED    PA10    Low

  LED1 is connected to ground and can be illuminated by driving the PA13
  output high, it shares the Sparks D7 output. The LED2,LED3 and LED4
  are pulled high and can be illuminated by driving the corresponding GPIO output
  to low.  CCC(LED_TO(1,0,0));
  CCC(LED_OFF());
  CCC(LED_TO(1,0,0));
  CCC(LED_OFF());


  The RGB LEDs are not used by the board port unless CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is
  defined.  In that case, the usage by the board port is defined in
  include/board.h and src/up_leds.c. The LEDs are used to encode OS-related
  events as follows:

      SYMBOL               Meaning                LED2    LED3   LED4
                                                  red     blue  green     Color
    ------------------- ----------------------- ------- ------- ------ ---------
    LED_STARTED         NuttX has been started  ON      OFF     OFF    Red
    LED_HEAPALLOCATE    Heap has been allocated OFF     ON      OFF    Blue
    LED_IRQSENABLED     Interrupts enabled      ON      OFF     ON     Orange
    LED_STACKCREATED    Idle stack created      OFF     OFF     ON     Green
    LED_INIRQ           In an interrupt**       ON      N/C     N/C    Orange Glow
    LED_SIGNAL          In a signal handler***  N/C     ON      N/C    Blue Glow
    LED_ASSERTION       An assertion failed     ON      ON      ON     White
    LED_PANIC           The system has crashed  ON      N/C     N/C    Red Flashing
    LED_IDLE            STM32 is is sleep mode  (Optional, not used)

    * If LED2, LED3, LED4 are statically on, then NuttX probably failed to boot
      and these LEDs will give you some indication of where the failure was
   ** The normal state is LED4 ON and LED2 faintly glowing.  This faint glow
      is because of timer interupts that result in the LED being illuminated
      on a small proportion of the time.
  *** LED3 may also flicker normally if signals are processed.

Serial Consoles
===============

  USART2
  -----
  If you have a 3.3 V TTL to RS-232 convertor then this is the most convenient
  serial console to use.  UART2 is the default in all of these
  configurations.

    USART2 RX  PA3   JP1 pin 4
    USART2 TX  PA2   JP1 pin 3
    GND             JP1 pin 2
    V3.3            JP2 pin 1

  Virtual COM Port
  ----------------
  Yet another option is to use UART0 and the USB virtual COM port.  This
  option may be more convenient for long term development, but was
  painful to use during board bring-up.
